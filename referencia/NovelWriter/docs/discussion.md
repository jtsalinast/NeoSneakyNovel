## 2025-05-26 - Multi-Genre Architecture: From Sci-Fi Only to Universal Story Generation

One of the most significant architectural changes to NovelWriter has been the expansion from a sci-fi-only tool to a comprehensive multi-genre story generation platform. This transformation required a complete rethinking of the application's core systems.

### The Challenge
The original NovelWriter was hardcoded for science fiction, with faction generation, character attributes, and world-building all specifically designed around space-faring civilizations, planetary systems, and technological themes. While this worked well for sci-fi stories, it became clear that the underlying approach could be generalized to support other genres with their own unique conventions and requirements.

### Genre Handler System
The solution was implementing a modular genre handler architecture:

- **Base Handler Interface**: Defined common methods that all genres must implement (faction generation, character creation, location systems, etc.)
- **Specialized Handlers**: Created dedicated handlers for 8 major genres, each with genre-specific logic
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Genre-specific UI tabs and parameters that adapt based on the selected genre

### Genre-Specific Adaptations
Each genre required careful consideration of its unique elements:

- **Sci-Fi**: Planetary systems, space factions, homeworld/home_system attributes
- **Fantasy**: Regional kingdoms, magical cities, race attributes, magic abilities
- **Historical Fiction**: Period-appropriate factions, social classes, historical territories
- **Horror**: Cults and supernatural organizations, sanity mechanics
- **Mystery**: Law enforcement agencies, investigation territories
- **Romance**: Social groups and family networks, relationship dynamics
- **Thriller**: Intelligence agencies, operational territories, security clearances
- **Western**: Frontier towns, territorial organizations, reputation systems

### Technical Implementation
The refactoring involved:

1. **Abstraction of Core Systems**: Extracting common functionality while allowing genre-specific customization
2. **Location Generalization**: Converting the hardcoded "planets" system to a generic "locations" system that works across genres
3. **Character Generation Overhaul**: Implementing genre-specific character generators with appropriate attributes and family structures
4. **Faction System Redesign**: Supporting different organizational types (factions, agencies, social groups, cults) based on genre conventions
5. **UI Adaptation**: Dynamic parameter tabs that show relevant options for each genre/subgenre combination

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Format Compatibility**: Ensuring faction data could be processed consistently across genres while maintaining genre-specific structure
- **Character Attribute Mapping**: Different genres needed different character attributes (homeworld vs homeland vs territory)
- **Story Arc Integration**: Making location-based storytelling work generically across all genres
- **Configuration Management**: Creating a flexible system for genre-specific settings and parameters

### Results
The multi-genre architecture has transformed NovelWriter from a niche sci-fi tool into a versatile story generation platform. Each genre now feels authentic to its conventions while sharing the same underlying story structure and generation pipeline. The modular design also makes it easier to add new genres in the future.

This expansion represents a fundamental shift in the project's scope and demonstrates how a well-designed architecture can evolve to support much broader use cases than originally envisioned.


## 2025-05-23 - New features, new documentation, overhaul of early process (background lore)
I made many updates to the app. A few updates to the process were made on the back of the challenges I faced with earlier versions of the app. One of the biggest challenges was the poor randomness from LLMs such as in the generation of names. This has been remedied by generating names locally without the help of LLMs.

Owing to the numerous challenges I found during the creation of this app I ended up writing a tool to analyze those weaknesses (LLM Creative Writing Tester). See the entry below for more details.

A few changes:

* Added local generation of character names and faction details (no LLM calls).
* Added ability to generate short stories.
* Improved coherency in scene planning by including the immediate previous scene information.
* Added support for Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI o3 and o4-mini. Also added Claude for the first time (3.5 and 3.7 available).
* Added new sub-directories for saving outputs.
* Added [documentation](./README.md) to the project. It covers the main files and functionality.
* Moved previously generated novels out of the project. I hope to upload these separately.


## 2025-03-31 - LLM Creative Writing Tester
I created an open-source tool for testing and analyzing creative writing capabilities of various Large Language Models (LLMs) from 3 of the biggest providers(OpenAI, Google, Anthropic). It was created out of a desire to better understand the weaknesses I found in text generation from LLMs.

The goal was to understand the models' consistency and variability when given the same prompt multiple times. Of particular interest was the detection of repeated elements—such as characters, locations, and themes—across different generations, which might indicate weak randomness or overly recurrent patterns in the model's output.

* The tool is here: [LLM Creative Writing Tester](https://github.com/EdwardAThomson/LLM-Creative-Writing-Analyzer/)
* An accompanying report with detailed result also exists: [report](https://github.com/EdwardAThomson/LLM-Creative-Writing-Analyzer/blob/main/reports/report.md)


## 2025-02-25 - Added support for Gemini

### Gemini
I've added the option to generate text using Google's Gemini. My primary testing was with Gemini 1.5 pro. The API allows for a huge input context window, potentially of 1 million tokens. This should be large enough for an entire model.

The output context window is far smaller, unfortunately it is only 8192 (confer 4o with 16,384). I'm finding that Gemini 1.5 can be lazy. If I ask it to preserve certain details it may well just ignore that request, or it changes the details (like minor character names) despite those details being in the prompt.

I haven't tested Gemini's reasoning models yet, but intuition suggests that non-reasoning models are missing some extra magic that makes them not quite fit-for-purpose for novel generation. I fear that better non-reasoning won't help. I could turn the temperature down to improve accuracy, but then it would affect creative output. 


## 2024-11-31 - Process Details

**Note:** The detailed generation process is now primarily documented in the [Overall Workflow](./workflow.md) document. This section provides historical context on the initial process design as of late 2024 / early 2025.

Here are greater details of the generation process. Please note that the generation process is evolving, so there is a chance that some details are off.

1. Collect parameters, generate high-level outline: briefly outline the setting, major technologies, major factions, the major conflict in the story, plus the key themes.
2. Generate Universe Background:
    1. Generate background details about the technology of the setting.
    2. Generate a list of major locations (originally planets, now genre-dependent).
    3. Generate more details for the factions. This goes beyond what is created by the first prompt.
    4. Generate a list of characters. This outlines their goals and motivations, but is a bit light in detail.
    5. Improve Character Details.
    6. Generate a list of relationships between the characters.
3. Generate a 6-act structure outline (Beginning, Rising Action, First Climax, Solution Finding, Second Climax, Resolution). . This will build out a rough structure based upon the idea generated in the first prompt.
4. Generate chapter outlines. This takes the acts created in the previous step and turns them into a series of chapters with short descriptions. The overall flow of the structure should match, but now have more details. OpenAI has produced outlines ranging from 10 - 18 chapters in testing, while Gemini can be 20 - 25.
5. Generate Scenes. The next step is to create individual scenes based upon the chapter outlines. There can be say 3-6 scenes per chapter. The prompt provides the full list of chapters when generating scenes. I think this is a big factor in maintaining coherency.
6. Generate prose on a scene-by-scene basis. One prompt is one scene which generates 700 - 1200 words. Each chapter has multiple scenes, so the number of words quickly adds up. The overall length is still short of a good novel, but it's getting there.


## 2024-11-31 - Initial developer entry
For the curious readers, I will outline some of the thinking behind this project.

### Project Goals
When first discovering LLMs it became apparent that they could one-day generate novel-length prose. I started to think about how to approach the idea, I could see that the problem had to be broken down into smaller tasks.

Here are the goals I set for the project:

* Demonstrate the feasibility of using LLMs to write a novel by breaking down the creative process into smaller, manageable tasks.
* Participate in NaNoGenMo by generating 50,000 words of coherent text using AI. ([**completed**](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2024/issues/31)).
* Develop an approach that allows for improvement over time.

To break the task down I figured I could potentially use the [Snowflake technique](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/) (I read about it many years ago). I haven't followed that technique exactly, but it was inspiration for the process I followed.

While searching online for previous attempts at this challenge I came across [David Shapiro](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveShap) who had put some thought into [Novel generation with LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=223ELutchs0), which he labelled AutoMuse, but seems he has paused that work. His ideas around cognitive architectures plus his general comments on how LLMs were helpful when I was developing this project.


### Impossible Goals?
I've seen a lot of people argue that it's not possible to write a novel with current LLMs, mainly due to the context window limitations or perhaps due to intelligence-level. However, neither of those are really the issue.

The idea is that since LLMs can't generate huge amounts of text at once, they're unsuitable for creating a cohesive story. But honestly, the idea of one-shotting a novel in a single LLM pass seems impractical—even for human authors, writing a novel is an iterative process. Authors like Stephen King might write fast, but they certainly don't write without planning, contemplation, and rewriting. So why would we expect an AI to one-shot a novel?

Smarter LLMs at the level of a professional writer with a giant context window may not still "solve" the problem, but I think some ability to plan and iteratve upon an answer should improve generation. Perhaps a more advanced version of o1, or an agent-based approach, would be best.

That being said, I've had a hypothesis for a while that GPT4 is sufficiently advanced that it could produce a novel if using multiple prompts and adding some extra process to ensur coherency. I think this project shows a path towards that goal. The limitations of context window can be somewhat mitigated by providing an over-arching plan for the code to follow: start at a high level, then delve into finer details while allowing the LLM to see some story context on either side of the section of interest. See The Generation Process for more details.

### Original Version
The original version was created as part of NaNoGenMo 2024 ([**completed**](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2024/issues/31)). The first version of the code was pushed to a different repo as I lost access to my GitHub account (fixed!), please find the original repo here: [NovelWriter](https://github.com/edthomson/NovelWriter). That code was not fully automated, but it did generate a 52,000-word novel (Echoes of Terra Nova).

The goal was to explore the potential of LLMs for long-form storytelling, breaking the problem into manageable pieces rather than attempting generation with a single prompt. The first version was rough and created in a rush to finished by the end of NaNoGenMo 2024, due to missing a lot of time during the month the code was less well-developed than I had hoped. In addition to not making the code quite as good as I had hoped, I didn't only use GPT-4o to generate the novel which had been a goal. I also o1-mini where I struggled to generate some background information with 4o, and then eventually I had to use o1-preview to generate the text. This was pretty expensive as I had to generate the text at least twice due to a logical error within the prompts.

Since then I've reworked the code such that it only needs to use the GPT-4o model for API calls, which has vastly reduced the costs and was a sub-goal when I started to goal. The big improvement came from adding a step in the process that generates individual scenes and not just high level chapter outlines.
