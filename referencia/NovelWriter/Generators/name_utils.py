Shared helpers for the genre name generators.

Every genre used to roll names, genders and titles independently, which led to
three recurring problems:

  * the same first name turning up two or three times in a single cast,
  * gendered titles landing on the wrong character ("Queen ..." on a male
    faction leader), because the title was drawn before the gender was known,
  * genders recorded inconsistently ("female" in horror, "Female" everywhere
    else), which broke downstream comparisons.

The helpers here give all the generators one way of doing each of those things.
